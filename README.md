## Libraries and Technologies Used

- **Navigation Component**: The Navigation Component simplifies navigation and UI management by allowing the app to have a single activity with multiple fragments. This architecture enhances code organization and user experience.

- **Firebase Auth**: Firebase Auth provides secure user authentication and registration, ensuring that user data is protected.

- **Firebase Firestore**: Firestore is used as the real-time database for storing product data. It enables seamless data synchronization across devices and supports real-time updates.

- **Firebase Storage**: Firebase Storage is used to store product images and user profile pictures. It offers reliable and scalable cloud storage for multimedia assets.

- **MVVM & LiveData**: MVVM architecture, coupled with LiveData, separates business logic from UI components and ensures that data is observed and updated consistently across the app.

- **Coroutines**: Coroutines facilitate asynchronous programming, enabling tasks to be executed in the background without blocking the main thread, leading to a more responsive user interface.

- **View Binding**: View Binding simplifies the process of referencing UI elements, reducing the risk of runtime errors and improving code readability.

- **Glide**: Glide is utilized for image loading and caching. It optimizes image loading, reducing load times and enhancing the overall user experience.

- **Dagger Hilt**: Dagger Hilt provides dependency injection, making it easier to manage dependencies and create modular, maintainable code.

- **Pagination**: Pagination is implemented to ensure a smooth user experience when loading additional product listings, enhancing app performance and usability.

## Project Progress

Kleine is an ongoing project, and we're continually working to enhance the user experience. Currently, our focus is on developing an Admin Console app that will enable merchants to publish new products, manage listings, and review sales statistics.

We believe that the careful selection of these tools and technologies has been pivotal in achieving the app's functionality and performance goals.

We welcome contributions from the community and encourage you to get involved in shaping the future of Kleine.
